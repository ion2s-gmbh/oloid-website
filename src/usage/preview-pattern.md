# Preview a pattern

The preview page of a pattern is shown after creating a new pattern or by navigation to a certain pattern via the top
navigation.

## Information about the pattern
* blade code
* generated HTML code
* scss code
* rendered preview of the pattern

## Actions on the preview page
* change the pattern's status
* view and edit the description
* copy the pattern's usage
* open the pattern in full screen
* rename the pattern (Keyboard shortcut `e`)
* remove the pattern (Keyboard shortcut `d`)

::: tip Status alerts
If your pattern uses other patterns, that have the status `rejected`, you will be notified.

::: danger
Notifications about rejected patterns currently only work if you use the workshop's custom blade directives to use patterns.
