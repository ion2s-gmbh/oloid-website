# Rename a pattern
On the preview page, you have the possibility to rename a pattern. As a consequence, the renamed pattern will be moved in the patterns folder to reflect the new name. Scss imports are changed, too.
Don't worry about the reference of the pattern in other templates. We keep track of these references and update them accordingly.

::: tip
**@include** and **custom directives** are affected if you rename a pattern.
