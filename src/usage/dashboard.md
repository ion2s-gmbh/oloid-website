# Dashboard
The Dashboard view shows patterns that have a status of `review` or `rejected`. These lists are important if you are
using the status based approval process within your team.

After pulling project updates from your concurrent versioning system, you will be presented patterns that a colleague 
of yours has marked `review` or `rejected`. You can review these patterns, change the status yourself and commit & push
your changes. 

In upcoming releases, the Dashboard will contain more information about your project. Stay tuned.
