# What is it?
With this package, you are able to extend your [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) based project with our web developer GUI.

The GUI helps you to create and manage **component-based templates** easier and faster than ever before. 
You gain an **overview of all components** and templates that are used in the project and **a focused live preview** where you can interact with them.

You can also provide a **pattern description** for each component to further clarify their usage and purpose, and work with **component nesting** to speed up your development process.

Make a change within a single component and see those changes reflected throughout the whole project. Further more you are also able to easily **mock dummy content** to bring your components to life and test how they fare with real content.

## We call it workshop
We call the developer GUI **workshop**. It's a place, where you craft your website with a lot of tools, that support 
your creative workflow.

## What is a pattern?
You might know partials or subviews. Think of patterns as reusable template snippets (partials) that you can use in 
your project's templates.
